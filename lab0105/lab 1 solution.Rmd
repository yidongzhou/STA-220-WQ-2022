```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE)
```

We could split a matrix A into a product A=QR where Q is a matrix with unit norm orthogonal vectors and R is an upper triangular matrix. Consider the following matrix A (see Lecture 2 c).) and compute the QR decomposition:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- c("bob" = 39, "carol" = 31, "ted" = 31, "alice" = 32)
X <- cbind(1, x)
colnames(X) <- c("Intercept", "Age")
X <- cbind(X, Sex = c(0,1,0,1))
X
A = solve(t(X) %*% X)
A
```

## Hint

You may use

`qr.X`, `qr.Q`, `qr.R` 

# Solution

The QR decomposition:

```{r, error=TRUE}
QR <- qr(A)
```
Rank of the matrix:

```{r, error=TRUE}
QR$rank
```
The Q factor:

```{r, error=TRUE}
Q <- qr.Q(QR) 
Q
```

The R factor:

```{r, error=TRUE}
R <- qr.R(QR)
R
```

Reconstructing the matrix A from its decomposition as follows:

```{r, error=TRUE}
qr.X(QR)
```
