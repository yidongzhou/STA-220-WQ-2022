# The Coupon Collector's Problem

Beginning in the late 19th century, tobacco companies, such as the
British manufacturer John Player and Son's, often included
[collector's cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_card) in
packets of cigarettes. Each packet contained one card, and a typical
series would consist of 25 to 50 related cards.  This gives rise to a
version of the famous coupon collector's problem: how many packets
does a consumer need to to buy in order to obtain a complete set of
the cards/coupons?

Of course the number of purchases required is random, so a better question
is: 

> What is the probability distribution of the number of purchases required to get a complete set of coupons?

To answer this question, we will make a few (reasonable) simplifying
assumptions.  Let $n$ represent the number of cards in a complete set.

a. Assume that each purchase is a random draw from the set of
   available cards.

b. Assume that the manufacturer produces the same number of each 
   card in the collection.

c. Assume that the total number of cards manufactured is large enough
   that our purchases do not appreciably change the population of
   cards remaining be purchased.
   
The idea is that we are sampling randomly from an extremely large
population in which the cards in the series appear in equal
proportions. Because the sample size is very small relative to the
size of the population, we can pretend that we are sampling *with
replacement* from the series of cards.

There is an obvious direct way to simulate this experiment: draw one
card at a time until we have at least one card of each type.  Here
is a function that uses this approach to simulate the number of
purchases required to obtain one complete set:

````{r coupon_slow, echo = TRUE}
coupon_slow <- function(n) {
    coupons <- rep(0L, n)
    while (any(coupons == 0L)) {
        new_coupon <- sample.int(n, 1)
        coupons[new_coupon] <- coupons[new_coupon] + 1
    }
    sum(coupons)
}
```

As discussed in class, one can speed things up by thinking more
carefully about the problem.  Let:

- $X_1$ be the number of draws needed to get our first card from the
  collection;
- $X_2$ be the number of additional draws needed to get a card
  different from the one we already have;
- $X_3$ be the number of additional draws needed to get a card
  different from the first two;
- etc.

Of course $X_1 \equiv 1$.  Then, on our next purchase the probability
that we get a card different from the first one is just
$\frac{n-1}{n}$, and we will continue to buy packets with this same
probability of "success" until we do get a card different from the
first one, with each purchase being independent of the last.  This
means that $X_2$ is a *geometrically distributed*^[We take the
geometric distribution to represent distribution of the number of
*trials* required to obtain the first success in a sequence of
independent trials where the probability of a success in each trial is
$p$.  Some authors count the number of *failures* before the first
sucess, so their geometric random variable is exactly one less than
ours.] random variable, with $p_2 = \frac{n-1}{n}$.

Then, having obtained two distinct cards from the collection, we begin
drawing to get a card different from the first two.  At each attempt,
the probability that we get a card different from the first two is
$\frac{n-2}{n}$, and $X_3$, the number of draws required to achieve
this goal is geometrically distributed with $p_3 = \frac{n-2}{n}$.  Note
also that $X_3$ is statistically independent of $X_1$ and $X_2$: the
number of packets that we had to purchase to get $2$ different cards
has no influence on the distribution of the number of additonal
packets we must buy to get our 3rd distinct card.

Continuing in this way, we see that the total number of purchase
required to get a complete set of $n$ distinct cards is
$$
S = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n,
$$
where $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are independent and each $X_k$ is
geometrically distributed with
$$
p_k = \frac{n-(k-1)}{n} = 1 - \frac{k-1}{n}.
$$

This is useful in more than one way.  For example, it is well known
that a geometric random variable has expected value (or mean)
$\frac{1}{p}$, and since the expected value of a sum of random
variables is the sum of their expectations, we can easily calculate
the expected value of $S$.  Similarly, the variance of a geometric
random variable is $\frac{1-p}{p^2}$, and because the variance of a
sum of *independent* random variables is equal to the sum of their
variances, we can also easily calculate the variance and hence the
standard deviation of $S$.^[In principal, we could also compute the
exact distribution of $S$, but this would be beyond the scope of this
class.]

This formulation also allows us to simulate the number of purchases
required to obtain a complete set of cards in a much more efficient way.

```{r coupon_fast, echo = TRUE}
coupon_fast <- function(n) {
    p <- 1 - (0:(n-1))/n
    x <- rgeom(n, p)  ## R counts only failures
    n + sum(x)  ## so add n * 1 = n to get the total
}
```

# Exercises

1. Write a function named `coupon_mean_sd` which computes the
   (theoretical) mean and standard deviation of $S$ and use it compute
   the mean and standard deviation when $n = 25$, $n = 50$, and $n =
   100$.
	


2. Use `system.time()` to compare the elaspsed times required for
   `coupon_slow()` and `coupon_fast()` to perform 10,000 replications
   of the coupon collectors problem for $n = 25$, $n = 50$, and $n =
   100$.  How many times slower is the slow function than the fast
   version?  Does the speed ratio depend on $n$?  (*Hint*: here and
   elsewhere in this assignment you should start with a smaller number
   of replications, say 100 or 1000, until you have everything worked
   out and debugged.  Only do 10,000 replications after you have all
   the code working correctly.)



3. For $n = 50$, compute 10,000 simulated values of $S$.  (Given the
   speed advantage, I would suggest that you use `coupon_fast()` for
   this, but you can use `coupon_slow()` if you prefer.)
   

   a. Compare the sample mean and standard deviation of your 10,000
      values to the theoretical values. Do they agree reasonably well?
      (Note: a large discrepancy would suggest that you may have made
      an error either in computing the theoretical mean and standard
      deviation or in your simulation code.)

   b. Use `hist()` to plot the estimated distribution of $S$. (Setting
      `nclass` to anything from 25 to 50 or so seems to work pretty
      well here. Use your judgement.)

   c. Estimate the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of $S$.

4. What if we were interested in the number of number of trials
   required to get $m$ complete sets? 
	
   Here is an adaptation of our earlier `coupon_fast()` function for
   this problem. Because of the additional bookkeeping required, its
   speed advantage over the slow version is much less pronounced.

```{r mcoupon_fast, echo = TRUE}
mcoupon_fast <- function(n, m) {
    coupons <- rep(0L, n)  # Will count each one until we have m of that coupon, then stop
    incomplete <- (coupons < m)
    S <- 0
    while (any(incomplete)) {
        k <- sum(incomplete)    # Number of coupons with fewer than m accumulated so far
        x <- rgeom(1, k/n) + 1  # Success is getting any one of the coupons we still need
        S <- S + x              # Update number of purchases
        y <- sample.int(k, 1)   # Which of the not-yet-completed coupons did we draw
        coupons[incomplete][y] <- coupons[incomplete][y] + 1   # Increment incomplete coupon counts
        incomplete <- (coupons < m)
    }
    S
}
```

   a. Add a second argument to `coupon_slow()` and modify the function
      to generate simulated values of $S$ for this problem.  Name your
      new function `mcoupon_slow()`.



   b. Using either your `mcoupon_slow()` or my `mcoupon_fast()`, use
      10,000 simulated replications of the experiment to estimate the
      mean, the standard deviation, and the 10th, 50th, and 90th
      percentiles of the number of purchases required to get $m = 2$
      complete collections of a series of $n = 50$ coupons.


   c. Repeat part (b) with $m = 3$.
