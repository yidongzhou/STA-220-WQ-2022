library(tidyverse)
# The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.
# e.g., ggplot2 for nice plot, dplyr for data manipulation, and so on
# The tidyverse also includes many other packages with more specialised usage. They are not loaded automatically with library(tidyverse), so youâ€™ll need to load each one with its own call to library()
# The one we are going to use is rvest (Easily Harvest (Scrape) Web Pages)
library(rvest)

# the zillow website for Sacramento
# You can definitely use ZillowR package, which serve as an R Inteface to Zillow Real Estate and Mortgage.
# However, here we want to use rvest package.

links <- sprintf("https://www.zillow.com/sacramento-ca/%d_p", 1:11)
# sprintf: A wrapper for the C function sprintf, that returns a character vector containing a formatted combination of text and variable values.
# equivalent to paste0("https://www.zillow.com/sacramento-ca/", 1:11, "_p")

# To build a data frame

# map: Apply a function or a formula to each element of a list or atomic vector
# .x represents one element in the first argument.
