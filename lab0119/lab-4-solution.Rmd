Consider  the data set Titanic  as follows:


     Description:

This data set provides information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner ‘Titanic’, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival.


     Format:

A 4-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 2201 observations on 4 variables. The variables and their levels are as follows:


- Class with 4 levels: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, Crew.

- Sex with 2 levels:  Male, Female.

- Age with 2 levels: Child, Adult.

- Survived with 2 levels: No, Yes.


For the data set Titanic  Compute  measures of frequency for the variables class and  survived.



## Hint

Use `apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)`.


# Solution

The data set

```{r }
dim(Titanic)
dimnames(Titanic)
```


The variable Survived

```{r }
sum(Titanic)
apply(Titanic, 4, sum)
round(100 * apply(Titanic, "Survived", sum) / sum(Titanic), 1)
apply(Titanic, 1, sum)
```


The variables Survived and Class


```{r }
apply(Titanic, c("Survived", "Class"), sum)
round(100 * apply(Titanic, c(4, 1), sum) / sum(Titanic), 1)
```
