**dplyr**


## Load library packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```


## UN data,  A world of information  

[data.un.org](http://data.un.org).


## Data

The data are [an excerpt from the Gapminder dataset](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder)

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
```


## subset data

- select
- filter
- arrange

### select

Subset the gapminder tibble (data frame) by columns.  Display only the `year` and the `pop` columns. 

The infix operator `%>%` is not part of base R, but is in fact defined by the package `magrittr` and is heavily used by `dplyr`. What the function does is to pass the left hand side of the operator to the first argument of the right hand side of the operator.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(year, pop) 

gapminder %>% 
  select(2:4, 6)
```

### filter

Subset the gapminder tibble, keeping data for the year 1987

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year==1987)

gapminder %>% 
  filter(year==1987) %>% 
  filter(continent=="Oceania")
```

### arrange

1. sort by populations
2. sort continent in reverse alphabetical order

    a. subsort in reverse chronological by year

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  arrange(pop)   


sorted_gap <-gapminder %>% 
  arrange(desc(continent), desc(year)) %>% 
  select(country, year, pop)

sorted_gap

gapminder

```


## Manipulate data

- mutate
- count 
- summarize
- group_by

### mutate

Create a new variable.  Make a new variable called "double_life" by multipling `lifeExp` by 2.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(double_life= lifeExp*2)
```

### count

How many observations exist for each country within the data set.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
   count(country) 
     

```

#### distinct

Sometimes you just want to know the values within a variable...

List the `distinct` values within the `continent` column

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  distinct(continent)

```

### summarize

Calculate the total of a single column.  In this case `sum()` all the values in the `pop` column.

```{r}
sum(5, 7, 10)

gapminder %>% 
  summarize(total_pop=sum(pop))
   
   
```

Of course, it makes no sense to total that column but now you know how to get column totals.  Generally we summarize subtotals using `group_by` along with summarize. group the observations by `year` and create subtotals with the `sum()` function. `comman()`: Comma Formatter: Format Number With Commas Separating Thousands.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
   group_by(year) %>% 
   summarize(total_pop=scales::comma(sum(pop))) 
```

Calculate the total and the mean population by year

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
   group_by(year) %>% 
   summarize(total_pop=scales::comma(sum(pop)),mean_pop=mean(pop)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_pop)) +
    geom_line() +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
```
