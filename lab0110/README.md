## Built-in constants

R has a small number of built-in constants. The following constants are available:

- `LETTERS`: the 26 upper-case letters of the Roman alphabet;

- `letters`: the 26 lower-case letters of the Roman alphabet;

- `month.abb`: the three-letter abbreviations for the English month names;

- `month.name`: the English names for the months of the year;

- `pi`: the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

## Random Samples and Permutations

[`sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/sample): the argument `replace` controls the way we sample (with replacement or not).
