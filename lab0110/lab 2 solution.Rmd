```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Draw a random sample of 5 letters without replacement from the first five letters of the English alphabet:

```{r }
sample(LETTERS[1:5], 5, replace = FALSE)
```

> What is the probability that the sample contains at least one of all
> five letters, i.e., at least one "A", at least one "B", at least one
> "C", at least one "D", AND at least one "E"?


Write a function to *estimate* the probability by performing many independent replications of the experiment and counting how often the event in question occurs.


# Solution


The probability is 1.

```{r}
my_simulator.s <- function(n_reps, n_ltrs, n_sample) {
  
  if(n_ltrs<n_sample){print("you can't take a sample without replacement larger than the population")}
                     else{n_successes <- 0   # Initialize counter
                         for (i in 1:n_reps) {
                         x <- sample(LETTERS[1:n_ltrs], n_sample, replace = FALSE)
                        is_success <- all(LETTERS[1:n_ltrs] %in% x)
                        n_successes <- n_successes + is_success
                        }
                        n_successes / n_reps}
                                                     }
```


```{r }
my_simulator.s(10000, 5, 5)
```
